Hi!

This is the personal web site of Eric Heflin. I'm glad you dropped by and I hope you find something valuable to you here!

**A Bit About Me**

Growing up on Air Force bases, I was immersed in a world of advanced technology and surrounded by individuals dedicated to serving our country. This environment instilled in me a profound appreciation for public service and a deep passion for technology.

I had the privilege of designing, building, deploying, and operating the largest Health Information Exchange in the United States. Since its inception, I have successfully protected this network against numerous attacks. Additionally, I serve on the Board of Directors for IHE USA, a healthcare non-profit, where I have led the development of critical standards in the health information exchange industry. As an instructor at the University of Texas at Austin, I teach cybersecurity, sharing my expertise with the next generation of professionals.

I have collaborated with organizations such as the Food and Drug Administration, Oracle Cerner, the Department of Veterans Affairs, IBM, and the Department of Defense, either as a contractor or sub-contractor. For a comprehensive overview of my career achievements and credentials, please refer to my CV.

I currently reside in Austin, Texas, with my wife and family. My personal mission is to address some of society's most pressing challenges, including healthcare data sharing and cybersecurity.

My love for technology and desire to serve culminated in my first company, Knowledge Dynamics Corp (1985-1997). I built an installer program that was used by over 30 million people per year in over 65 countries. This business drastically simplified the installation process for early computer programs. After that, I needed my next mission, I noticed that healthcare information had no security, was not interoperable, and could not scale to serve the nation. So I co-founded eHealth Exchange, now the USA's largest healthcare information exchange network. My goal now is to help the world have better cybersecurity. Right now the bad actors are winning and I want to change that. I want to tip the scales in favor of the good. Combining my business acumen with my technical expertise, I am able to bring feasible cybersecurity solutions with positive ROIs to the table, making cyber security a little more rational to the CEO.
