Welcome to my {{<current_year>}}personal website!

{{< img src="2024/Eric Heflin 1.jpg" alt="Eric Heflin photograph">}}

I'm Eric Heflin, and I'm, well... a lot of things, ha! Here are a few of the roles I play in my life:

- Family man (husband, father, son)
- Cybersecurity professional
- Teacher
- Student
- Healthcare Information Technology (IT) architect
- Scientist
- Inventor
- Entrepreneur
- Public servant
- Friend
- Mentor
- Software Engineer
- Computer Scientist
- Patriotic citizen
- Aviator
- Maker

The primary goal of this web site is to answer a few questions you may have:

- How can I keep myself, my friends, by family, my co-workers, and my company safer in terms of cybersecurity?
- How can I learn more about cybersecurity and healthcare IT?
- Who is Eric Heflin?

Although I've very interested in political, moral, religious and ethical areas, I have elected to keep this 
site free of my opinions on all of these topics except ethics. I reason that the odds of me changing your 
opinion on something via my web site are nearly zero. And I much rather have a conversation about these 
topics over a glass of your favorite beverage where I can learn your views too! So this web site is 
deliberately apolitical. Also, I'm a Professor (Instructor) at the University of Texas at Austin, and I feel
teachers should not introduce bias into discussions. 

But I want to remind you of a few of my favorite thoughts (from others) regarding politics:

- Democracy is not a spectator sport
- Those that chose not to get involved in politics are doomed to be governed by the inferior

I hope you find something of value here!
